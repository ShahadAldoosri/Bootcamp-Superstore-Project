# SuperStore Sales Analysis



## Background
I have been provided with orders and sales data from SuperStore, a global retail chain specializing in office supplies. The dataset includes a comprehensive record of transactions across multiple years and regions, covering various aspects of the business, such as product performance, customer behavior, and regional sales.
## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to reproduce a Tableau workbook that addresses key business questions and provides actionable insights. The workbook will be designed based on a set of functional specifications outlined in SuperStore_Tableau.pptx. Through this analysis, I aim to help the SuperStore management team understand sales trends, identify top-performing products and customers, and evaluate regional performance.
